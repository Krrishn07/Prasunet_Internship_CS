# Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption

## Overview
This project involves implementing image encryption through pixel manipulation. By applying mathematical operations to each pixel, the project aims to secure visual data effectively.

## What I Learned
- **Image Encryption Techniques**: Applying encryption directly to image pixels for securing visual data.
- **Pixel Manipulation**: Altering pixel values and applying basic mathematical operations for encryption.
- **Algorithm Development**: Developing an encryption algorithm using XOR for image encryption.

## Project Highlights
- **Encryption/Decryption Functions**: Created functions for encrypting and decrypting images by manipulating pixel values.
- **XOR Operation**: Utilized XOR operations to ensure robust encryption and decryption of image data.
- **User Interface**: Designed an interface for users to upload images and apply encryption or decryption.

## Fun Fact
ðŸ¤“ Image encryption through pixel manipulation is a technique often used in modern security systems to protect visual data. XOR operations are fundamental due to their simplicity and effectiveness!

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pillow library (`pip install pillow`)

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-encryption.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
    ```sh
    cd image-encryption
    ```
3. **Run the Script**:
    ```sh

    ```
4. **Upload Image and Apply Encryption/Decryption**:
    Follow the on-screen instructions to upload your image and apply the desired operation.

### Example
```python
# Encrypting an image
Input:  "sample_image.png"
Operation:  Encrypt
Output: "encrypted_image.png"

# Decrypting an image
Input:  "encrypted_image.png"
Operation:  Decrypt
Output: "sample_image.png"
