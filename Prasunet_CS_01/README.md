# Caesar Cipher Implementation

## Overview
This project involves implementing the Caesar Cipher, one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques. The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in a plaintext message by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

## What I Learned
- **Fundamentals of Encryption**: Understanding basic encryption methods and their practical applications.
- **Algorithm Design**: Developing a simple and effective algorithm to shift letters and secure messages.
- **Coding and Debugging**: Enhancing my Python skills through coding and debugging the cipher logic.

## Project Highlights
- **Encryption/Decryption Functions**: Developed functions to encrypt and decrypt messages.
- **Shift Variation**: Implemented variable shift values to demonstrate flexibility in encryption.
- **User Input Handling**: Created an intuitive interface for users to input messages and choose shift values.

## Fun Fact
ðŸ¤“ The Caesar Cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to encode his military messages. Itâ€™s one of the oldest known encryption techniques still in use today!

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/caesar-cipher.git`
2. **Navigate to the Directory**: `cd caesar-cipher`
3. **Run the Script**: `python caesar_cipher.py`
4. **Input Message and Shift Value**: Follow the on-screen instructions to encrypt or decrypt your message.

## Example
```python
# Encrypting a message with a shift of 3
Input:  "HELLO"
Shift:  3
Output: "KHOOR"

# Decrypting a message with a shift of 3
Input:  "KHOOR"
Shift:  3
Output: "HELLO"
