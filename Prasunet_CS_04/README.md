# ðŸŽ¯Prasunet_CS_04
# ðŸŽ¯Simple Keylogger

## Overview
This project involves creating a simple keylogger that captures keystrokes on a computer. The tool is designed to record keystrokes in a secure and non-intrusive manner for analysis and monitoring purposes.

## What I Learned
- **Keystroke Logging**: Understanding the techniques used to capture and record keyboard input on a system.
- **Python Libraries for Keylogging**: Exploring libraries such as pynput for developing keylogging applications.
- **Algorithm Development**: Storing and managing recorded keystroke data securely and efficiently.

## Project Highlights
- **Keystroke Capture**: Created functions for encrypting and decrypting images by manipulating pixel values.
- **Data Security**: Ensured that the logged data is stored securely, protecting sensitive information.
- **Stealth Operation**: Designed the keylogger to run unobtrusively in the background, with minimal impact on system performance.

## Fun Fact
ðŸ¤” Keyloggers can be used for both malicious and legitimate purposes. While often associated with cybercrime, they can also be used for parental control, employee monitoring, or usability testing to improve user experience.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pynput library (pip install pynput)

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/Prasunet_Internship_CS.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
    ```sh
    cd Prasunet_CS_04
    ```
3. **Run the Script**:
    ```sh
    python Simple_Keylogger.py
    ```
4. **Assign Image and Apply Encryption/Decryption**:
    Follow the on-screen instructions to start logging keystrokes. The logged data will be stored in a text file for later analysis.

### Example
```python
# Logging keystrokes
- Start the keylogger by running the script.
- Type anything on your keyboard.
- Stop the keylogger and check the output file for logged keystrokes.

# Sample Logged Data
Output: "Key Pressed: H, Key Pressed: e, Key Pressed: l, Key Pressed: l, Key Pressed: o"
